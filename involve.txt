- Plant native species: Creating planet- and wildlife-friendly environments can start right in your own backyard and in your community. Plant native species of trees, bushes, and plants, especially those that flower and provide food sources for wild animals.
- Help the zoo or aquarium: Zoos and aquariums often have wildlife conservation efforts. Find out how you can volunteer to help spread the word about or work to support wild animals through the Association of Zoo Docents and Volunteers
- Make your yard a wild life heaven: In addition to planting native food sources for wildlife in your area, you can also help them create habitats by installing bird feeders, baths, and houses
- Avoid harmful chemicals: In our efforts to spur lawn growth and control pests, we may turn to chemical solutions, which can be very harmful to wildlife like bees and butterflies that are helpful to the environment.
- Pick up trash: Picking up trash not only protects the environment and keeps our surroundings beautiful, but it can also save wildlife. Plastic bags and twine can easily trap birds and other smaller animals, hurting or killing them or making them easy prey. So put on your gloves, grab some trash bags, and pick up litter to protect wildlife—and keep your neighborhood looking good.
- Adopt an animal: Protect the animal of your choice—one either threatened by endangerment in a far-off land or by abandonment nearby.Defenders of Wildlife lets you symbolically adopt a wild animal of your choosing. Your donation goes to improving habitats, research, monitoring, and ultimately saving the species from endangerment. Make it a birthday gift for your animal fanatic friend! 
- Understand human impact: Population increases pose a threat to wildlife as previous resources diminish. Whether it’s for science, food or greed, humans endanger animals, sometimes without considering the positive impact wildlife can have on the posterity of our planet. What can you do? Stay informed on the issues, know your impact in the ecosystem and take your part in protecting wildlife. Earth and its present and future habitants will be grateful.
